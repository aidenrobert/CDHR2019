# CDHR2019: Climate, natural disasters, and human responses

*Climate, natural disasters, and human responses* is an interdisciplinary study carried out as a collaboration between the Department of Meteorology (MISU) and the Department of Economic History and International Relations (EkoHist) at Stockholm University. The project seeks to investigate human responses to natural disasters in the modern climate (2006-2017) using a broad range of social, economic, and physical variables. The key participants in the project are Lisa Dellmuth and Christian Hultgren (EkoHist), and Frida Bender and Aiden Jönsson (MISU).

This repository is used to store code used for the project (primarily initiated by Aiden Jönsson to collect scripts used to calculate meteorological variables for the project) and to make the methods used for the research open to the community for use and for the reproducibility of the results.

The scripts used to calculate the statistical variables from the raw reanalysis data are included here; the resulting reanalysis data used for this project will be available at the [Bolin Center for Climate Research's open database](https://bolin.su.se/data/). Geometric files of geographical boundaries needed for this project are available at [the GADM website.](https://gadm.org/download_world.html)
