Climate, natural disasters, and human responses is an interdisciplinary study carried out as a collaboration between the Department of Meteorology (MISU) and the Department of Economic History and International Relations (EkoHist) at Stockholm University. The project seeks to investigate human responses to natural disasters in the modern climate (2006-2017) using a broad range of social, economic, and physical variables. The key participants in the project are Lisa Dellmuth and Christian Hultgren (EkoHist), and Frida Bender and Aiden JÃ¶nsson (MISU).

This repository is used to store code used for the project, and to make the methods used for the research open to the community.
